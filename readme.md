# RSA Brute Force Simulation

A simple RSA brute force simulation made with `C` in the purpose of fulfilling the **IF2120 Matematika Diskrit** paper assignment.

## How to Use

1. Generate the `prime.txt` using `primeToTxt.c` by entering the maximum size (in bits) of the `p` and `q` RSA value
2. Compile and run `crackRSA.c` and wait for the result
